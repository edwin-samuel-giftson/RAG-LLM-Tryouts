Cultivating a positive workplace culture: the catalyst for success\n","2.1  Positive psychology and positive intelligence: foundations for a positive \n","organizational culture\n","A positive workplace culture encompasses a range of components that foster a \n","harmonious and productive working atmosphere. While it is not synonymous with \n","positive psychology or positive intelligence, it certainly draws on principles from \n","these areas to create a workplace where employees can thrive, grow , and contribute \n","positively to the organization’ s success. Hence, it is crucial to examine positive \n","psychology and positive intelligence to a certain extent.\n","Positive psychology  is a field of psychology focusing on the positive aspects \n","of human behavior and well-being. A positive workplace culture aligns with posi-\n","tive psychology by emphasizing aspects like employee well-being, recognition, \n","and personal growth. It encourages practices such as gratitude, mindfulness, and \n","strengths-based approaches to foster a more positive and fulfilling work experience \n","for employees.\n","Positive psychology is closely linked to the concept of happiness, which incor-\n","porates both the idea of a state (how we feel at a given moment) and the general \n","satisfaction with life [1]. However, there is a difference between happiness and \n","positivity, with the former indicating the state (how we feel) and the latter being a \n","mindset set at a positive level [2]. Actually, the concept of well-being was studied long \n","before discussing positive psychology. Subjective well-being (SWB) subsumes a set of \n","constructs that include happiness, life satisfaction, and morale [3].\n","Within the realm of positive psychology, a widely recognized model is the PERMA \n","model [4], which consists of five distinct components that individuals intrinsically \n","seek and that can be individually examined:\n","• P - Positive Emotion\n","• E - Engagement\n","• R - Relationships\n","• M - Meaning\n","• A - Accomplishment\n","This model highlights various facets of well-being and personal fulfillment, each \n","representing a vital aspect of an individual’ s psychological and emotional experience.\n","Positive emotions refer to a wide range of feelings beyond joy and happiness, includ-\n","ing enthusiasm, satisfaction, pride, hope, interest, love, compassion, amusement, \n","and gratitude. Cultivating these emotions can enhance well-being [5]. Additionally, \n","resilience is crucial when facing adversity, and positive emotions can help develop \n","coping strategies and recover faster from challenging situations [6, 7].

Nevertheless, researchers have introduced diverse dimensions or styles of \n","organizational culture to evaluate and contrast different organizations’ cultures. \n","This approach helps pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of each culture. In this \n","context, the term “positive” implies a comparative aspect, suggesting better out-\n","comes. For example, a well-known framework for measuring the organizational cul-\n","ture is the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI) [23]. It identifies \n","four main types of organizational culture: clan, adhocracy, market, and hierarchy. \n","Each type of culture has its own characteristics, values, and assumptions, as well as \n","its own advantages and disadvantages. According to the OCAI, a positive organiza-\n","tional culture is one that balances the competing values of flexibility and stability. \n","Another example of a well-known framework is the Denison Organizational Culture \n","Survey (DOCS) [24], which assesses four primary dimensions of culture: involve-\n","ment, consistency, adaptability, and mission. According to the DOCS, a positive \n","organizational culture is one that fosters high levels of employee engagement, align-\n","ment, innovation, and direction.\n","Conversely, we can interpret “positive” as an indication that this type of organi-\n","zational culture is grounded in what is known as positive psychology, which aligns \n","with the perspective presented in this chapter. From this perspective, organizations \n","characterized by a positive organizational culture prioritize employee recognition \n","and foster an environment where employees are empowered to develop, flourish, and \n","perform at their highest capabilities [25].\n","A positive workplace culture promotes learning, inclusion, and well-being \n","among employees and aligns with the core values and goals of the organization. It \n","serves as the cornerstone of organizational success and employee well-being. Like \n","organizational culture in general, it encompasses the shared values, beliefs, behav -\n","iors, and practices that define how individuals interact within an organization, yet \n","it comprises particular dimensions that define it. To truly understand the essence \n","of a positive workplace culture, it is essential to delve into its various dimensions \n","and explore why it is considered a driving force in contemporary organizations. \n","These dimensions are articulated in various ways by different authors. However, for \n","the purpose of this chapter, we acknowledge the following nine dimensions as the \n","primary ones.\n","2.2.1 Well-being initiatives\n","These are an integral part of a positive organizational culture, specifically within \n","the context of promoting employee well-being and creating a positive work environ-\n","ment, and it is reflected in values, priorities, norms, practices, etc. A positive culture \n","places a premium on employee well-being, both physical and mental. Wellness \n","programs, work-life balance initiatives, and stress management support are integral \n","components. Organizations can implement a series of organizational practices to \n","enhance workplace happiness and well-being. These may include shifting from \n","performance evaluations centered on weaknesses to those emphasizing strengths, \n","aligning job tasks with employees’ unique characteristics through the “job crafting” \n","approach to create more personally meaningful work experiences, and incorporating \n","solution-focused brief coaching techniques [26].\n","\n","1\n","Chapter\n","Fostering a Positive Workplace \n","Culture: Impacts on Performance \n","and Agility\n","Cătălina Radu\n","Abstract\n","This chapter explores the profound influence of a positive workplace culture on \n","work performance and organizational agility.
