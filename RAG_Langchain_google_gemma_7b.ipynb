Cultivating a positive workplace culture: the catalyst for success\\n2.1  Positive psychology and positive intelligence: foundations for a positive \\norganizational culture\\nA positive workplace culture encompasses a range of components that foster a \\nharmonious and productive working atmosphere. While it is not synonymous with \\npositive psychology or positive intelligence, it certainly draws on principles from \\nthese areas to create a workplace where employees can thrive, grow , and contribute \\npositively to the organization’ s success. Hence, it is crucial to examine positive \\npsychology and positive intelligence to a certain extent.\\nPositive psychology  is a field of psychology focusing on the positive aspects \\nof human behavior and well-being. A positive workplace culture aligns with posi-\\ntive psychology by emphasizing aspects like employee well-being, recognition, \\nand personal growth. It encourages practices such as gratitude, mindfulness, and \\nstrengths-based approaches to foster a more positive and fulfilling work experience \\nfor employees.\\nPositive psychology is closely linked to the concept of happiness, which incor-\\nporates both the idea of a state (how we feel at a given moment) and the general \\nsatisfaction with life [1]. However, there is a difference between happiness and \\npositivity, with the former indicating the state (how we feel) and the latter being a \\nmindset set at a positive level [2]. Actually, the concept of well-being was studied long \\nbefore discussing positive psychology. Subjective well-being (SWB) subsumes a set of \\nconstructs that include happiness, life satisfaction, and morale [3].\\nWithin the realm of positive psychology, a widely recognized model is the PERMA \\nmodel [4], which consists of five distinct components that individuals intrinsically \\nseek and that can be individually examined:\\n• P - Positive Emotion\\n• E - Engagement\\n• R - Relationships\\n• M - Meaning\\n• A - Accomplishment\\nThis model highlights various facets of well-being and personal fulfillment, each \\nrepresenting a vital aspect of an individual’ s psychological and emotional experience.\\nPositive emotions refer to a wide range of feelings beyond joy and happiness, includ-\\ning enthusiasm, satisfaction, pride, hope, interest, love, compassion, amusement, \\nand gratitude. Cultivating these emotions can enhance well-being [5]. Additionally, \\nresilience is crucial when facing adversity, and positive emotions can help develop \\ncoping strategies and recover faster from challenging situations [6, 7]. Studies have\\n\\nHuman Resource Management - An Update\\n4\\n2.2 Crafting the essence: deconstructing the positive workplace culture\\nDefining a positive organizational culture is not a one-size-fits-all task, as \\ndifferent cultures may be more suitable for varying organizations, industries, and \\ncontexts. Nevertheless, researchers have introduced diverse dimensions or styles of \\norganizational culture to evaluate and contrast different organizations’ cultures. \\nThis approach helps pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of each culture. In this \\ncontext, the term “positive” implies a comparative aspect, suggesting better out-\\ncomes. For example, a well-known framework for measuring the organizational cul-\\nture is the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI) [23]. It identifies \\nfour main types of organizational culture: clan, adhocracy, market, and hierarchy. \\nEach type of culture has its own characteristics, values, and assumptions, as well as \\nits own advantages and disadvantages. According to the OCAI, a positive organiza-\\ntional culture is one that balances the competing values of flexibility and stability. \\nAnother example of a well-known framework is the Denison Organizational Culture \\nSurvey (DOCS) [24], which assesses four primary dimensions of culture: involve-\\nment, consistency, adaptability, and mission. According to the DOCS, a positive \\norganizational culture is one that fosters high levels of employee engagement, align-\\nment, innovation, and direction.\\nConversely, we can interpret “positive” as an indication that this type of organi-\\nzational culture is grounded in what is known as positive psychology, which aligns \\nwith the perspective presented in this chapter. From this perspective, organizations \\ncharacterized by a positive organizational culture prioritize employee recognition \\nand foster an environment where employees are empowered to develop, flourish, and \\nperform at their highest capabilities [25].\\nA positive workplace culture promotes learning, inclusion, and well-being \\namong employees and aligns with the core values and goals of the organization. It \\nserves as the cornerstone of organizational success and employee well-being. Like \\norganizational culture in general, it encompasses the shared values, beliefs, behav -\\niors, and practices that define how individuals interact within an organization, yet \\nit comprises particular dimensions that define it. To truly understand the essence \\nof a positive workplace culture, it is essential to delve into its various dimensions \\nand explore why it is considered a driving force in contemporary organizations. \\nThese dimensions are articulated in various ways by different authors. However, for \\nthe purpose of this chapter, we acknowledge the following nine dimensions as the \\nprimary ones.\\n2.2.1 Well-being initiatives\\nThese are an integral part of a positive organizational culture, specifically within \\nthe context of promoting employee well-being and creating a positive work environ-\\nment, and it is reflected in values, priorities, norms, practices, etc. A positive culture \\nplaces a premium on employee well-being, both physical and mental. Wellness \\nprograms, work-life balance initiatives, and stress management support are integral \\ncomponents. Organizations can implement a series of organizational practices to \\nenhance workplace happiness and well-being. These may include shifting from \\nperformance evaluations centered on weaknesses to those emphasizing strengths, \\naligning job tasks with employees’ unique characteristics through the “job crafting” \\napproach to create more personally meaningful work experiences, and incorporating \\nsolution-focused brief coaching techniques [26].\\n\\n1\\nChapter\\nFostering a Positive Workplace \\nCulture: Impacts on Performance \\nand Agility\\nCătălina\\xa0Radu\\nAbstract\\nThis chapter explores the profound influence of a positive workplace culture on \\nwork performance and organizational agility. It delves into the multidimensional \\naspects of positive psychology, organizational culture, and their interplay in creating \\na flourishing work environment. A positive workplace culture, informed by principles \\nfrom positive psychology, sets the stage for a thriving and engaged workforce. By \\ncultivating an environment that values employee well-being, growth, and collabora-\\ntion, organizations can unlock the full potential of their teams and enhance overall \\nperformance. This chapter examines how a positive culture positively impacts work \\nperformance, leading to increased productivity, efficiency, and quality of work. \\nWe delve into the key elements of a positive workplace culture, including fostering \\na growth mindset, encouraging resilience in the face of challenges, and promot-\\ning psychological safety. Through these components, employees are empowered to \\ntake risks, innovate, and embrace change, contributing to enhanced organizational \\nagility, which means companies can adapt quickly to changing market dynamics and \\nseize new opportunities. Therefore, this chapter offers valuable insights for human \\nresources (HR) professionals, managers, and leaders seeking to create a positive, agile \\nwork environment that fuels organizational success.\\nKeywords: positive psychology, organizational culture, work performance, \\norganizational agility, workforce well-being, work engagement\\n1.
